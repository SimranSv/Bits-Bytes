 A Brief Review about this Project:
Project Name:Ph7 a PharmaHelp.

This project is created to add a technical aspect between the Doctors,Patient
and a Chemist .So how does this work ?
Working:
We have provided a login /sign in page for a Doctor  and for a Patient.
 Here the Doctor has to enter his mail id and password . why so ?
Because it ensures that the data of patient is safe and in right hands 
Since the data is encrypted and all the API's are Secured
 Next a patient has to enter his name email id password his first name and last name. 
A page for Medicine list would appear where doctor has to enter the medicines required for the 
treatement of disease. 
The patient will receive the link on his/her email account this link would contain Patients name, .
this link will contain a Qr code, Prescrition List and patients name. 
The data of each patient is Stored with Doctor Along with date and time and Prescription aswell.
The above information gives you a brief review that how a user would work with this site, and how do things actually work.
